Shots were fired as the suspects left, but no one was injured. Police spotted the suspects\' silver Saturn driving away from the fast food restaurant and chased them onto I-95. During a chase with speeds up to 95 mph, an officer said he saw five muzzle flashes from the suspects\' car. A bullet struck a Florida Highway Patrol car. The car chase ended when the suspects stopped and ran on foot in Deerfield Beach. Sgt. Philip Hawkins and another officer encountered one of the armed men. He was \"blading\" toward them, meaning he turned his body as if to fire. He didn\'t shoot. Hawkins fired five shots, hitting him in the leg.  The man wasn\'t arrested until a short time later.  No gun was found. Hawkins had left his off-duty side job at Muvico to join the pursuit. By the time the chase ended, 20 Boynton Beach units were in Broward County.
